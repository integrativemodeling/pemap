Data and code for Integrative Structure Determination using data from point mutant epistatic miniarray profile (pE-MAP). 

# pE-Map data
The clustered pE-MAP for the histones and correlation maps are available in the supplementary data of [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6522/eaaz4910.abstract].
The yeast RNAPII pE-MAP is available in the supplementary materials of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413009380].
The bacterial RNAP point mutation data are available in the supplementary materials of [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.155770v1.abstract].

# Modeling of the H3-H4 dimer

## Data for simulations (directory modeling_histones/data)

Data used for modeling includes:

1) Script and alignments to generate comparative models.

2) Comparative models of H3 and H4

3) Processed pE-MAP data files containing the pairs of residues to which the pE-MAP distance restraints will be applied. The format of these files is:

```
protein1 protein2 residue1 residue2 MIC_value distance_in_xray_structure (if known)
```

4) Python scripts to shuffle and resample the pE-MAP data files


## Running the simulations (directory modeling_histones/modeling)

-  `top_his_comp_models.dat`: Topology file containing the representation of the h3-h4 system. Each protein has presented as a rigid body. Histones tails are not considering for modeling. 

-  `mod_pemap_histones.py`: PMI modeling scripts for running the production simulations. The search for good-scoring models relied on Replica Exchange Gibbs sampling, based on the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm.  We recommend producing at least 2,500,000 models from 50 independent runs, each starting from a different initial conformation of H3-H4 dimer to have proper statistics.

## Analysis of simulations (directory modeling_histones/analysis)
The analysis uses the PMI_analysis module in: https://github.com/salilab/PMI_analysis


1) `run_analysis_trajectories.py`: 

2) `run_extract_models.py`: Get the rmf3 files for a random sampled of 30,000 structures in the ensemble. These structures are split into two sets (sample_A, sample_B)

3) `run_clustering.sh`:
